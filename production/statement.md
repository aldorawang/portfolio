My name is Aldora Wang, and I am a stduent majoring Design and Technology at Parsons.

Here are my three Design Values

Design value #1 Saying something

- It does not have to tell something bold but something behind/about the artwork/design/product. It can be a reason/story/feeling.

Design value #2 Aesthetic is important

- For me, aesthetics is a big part of a project. I think it is important for me to like the way my projects look.

Design value #3 Stay true to myself

- I would like to tell something about myself as a designer through my projects. I want my projects to show who I am and what I believe.
