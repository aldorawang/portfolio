Project 1
Collaborative Poetry
I am designing an interactive website for collaborative poetry that will make connections between people through a creative way of making poetry together. The purpose of this project is for people, especially poetry lovers, to interact with each other through reading others' lines and adding more lines into the poem. The project is based on the human social network. Nowadays, people like to post on social media, and there are always some fun and creative captions. People sometimes talk in a poetic way. There are chances for everyone to be a poet. This project is a place for people to express and collaborate. The website might provide different fonts and sizes for users to choose to create more visuals.

Project 2
Oblique Environments: Beach Scene
I am telling a story about a little boy in a fictional world. This virtual environment will exaggerate the environmental issue, especially the issue of trash, by reimagining the physical space. The original space is Coney Island, and I am combining it with my memory of a beach in Bali. The reason I choose to focus on the trash on the beach is that I remember a beautiful sunset scene on a beach in Bali, but there was so much trash on the beach. The purpose of this project is to communicate the message of protecting our land. The little boy within the virtual space is granted the ability to fix the environmental issue by collecting a seashell.
